demo website for a PHP build 

This was a demo in creating a CMS based PHP site in my class for PHP. I decided to create an RWD in it's format that changed in design breaks as opposed to formatted breakpoints.
Alot of what I drew from the website is from the "Responsive Web Design" Book from Ethan M. I have tons of work to do in the future and 
plan on implementing a "mobile first" ideology when making design mockups.
